## Other Useful Info/Directions
A crude yet simple example is the 'populate_users.py' file in the project directory. by running 'python populate_users.py', it will create 10 users by default via faker. Install with 'pip install faker' if necessary. Another method is called 'fixtures', but it was complicated and difficult to work with, look into it if necessary.
