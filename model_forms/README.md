# Overview/Purpose of this Django Project
Purpose is to provide a simple example of using Model Forms. They differ from regular forms, on the simple level, they take all of their fields from a specified model, and can save info directly to the model.

## Other Useful Info/Directions
I demonstrate 3 ways to specify the fields in the model form, how to include them all, specify which fields to exclude, and how to specify which fields to include. Also describes the difference between user.save(commit = True) and user.save(commit = False)
