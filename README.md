# django-practice-tutorials-and-refreshers
A repository where I can keep different django apps that I create for practice, to follow along with tutorials, play with new practices, work on improving my django skills, etc. This way I can keep it on github, and look back at these later as refreshers.

## Getting Started
Each folder is it's own Django project and works independenlty of the others, they may use different virtualenvs. Each project will have a README file that specifies it's purpose, virtualenv, version of python/django used, etc.
