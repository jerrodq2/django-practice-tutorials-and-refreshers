# django-practice-tutorials-and-refreshers
A repository where I can keep different django apps that I create for practice, to follow along with tutorials, play with new practices, work on improving my django skills, etc. This way I can keep it on github, and look back at these later as refreshers. The initial purpose isn't for this repository to be one giant Django project, each project is meant to be standalone, the repository is just a place to hold them. If some projects practice linking to other projects in this repository, it will be specified.

## Getting Started
Each folder is it's own Django project and works independenlty of the others, they may use different virtualenvs. Each project will have a README file that specifies it's purpose, virtualenv, version of python/django used, etc. The different projects are lsited below along with what they show or can be looked at for a refresher

## Note
Due to most of these using Django version 2.0.4, the syntax of some things (such as using url vs path in the urls.py files) may be different than what you normally use
