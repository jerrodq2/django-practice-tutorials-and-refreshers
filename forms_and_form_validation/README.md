# Overview/Purpose of this Django Project
To demonstrate the use of Django forms and different methods of validating your forms.

## Other Useful Info/Directions
The first app, users, demonstrates a simple use of Django forms. We create a form model, access it in the view, and pass it onto the template, where it is injected.
The second, third, and fourth app each demonstrate a different way to validate your forms.

The second app demonstrates the use of the 'clean_inputName' method, which can be used for specific fields/inputs on your forms.

The third app demonstrates custom validation methods.

And the fourth app demonstrates the 'clean' method which affects the entire form and can be used for each or any input.
